# 2. On Soma (or another linux machine) with .Xresources available and running X and a remoting to another machine. [RGB]
# 3. On Soma (or another linux machine) with .Xresources available but NOT running X and a local (or remote) connection. [256]
# 4. Using putty with a saved, setup session, remote or local. [RGB]
# 5. Using putty without a saved session, remote or local. [256]
